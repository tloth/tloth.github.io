        Project overview

      <div class="case_study-section">
        <h3>The product</h3>
        <p>
          A progressive web app to help you find a suitable toilet fast when
          you're out and about in London.
        </p>
        <h3>Project duration</h3>
        <p>
          3 weeks in May 2019: a one-week design sprint, and two one-week
          development sprints.
        </p>

        <h3>The problem</h3>
        <p>
          Drinking the recommended 2 litres of water a day means you need to use
          the toilet often. It can be especially inconvenient when you're out in
          the city and away from a toilet. It would be nice if you could track
          down the nearest public toilet, whether it be a McDonald's, a
          portapotty, or a free museum. An added bonus would be if the app could
          tell you how much the toilet costs if not free, and give it a
          cleanliness rating.
        </p>

        <h3>The goal</h3>
        <p>
          Provide users with a quick and easy way of finding the nearest public
          toilet.
        </p>

        <h3>My role & responsibilities</h3>
        <p>
          I was the UX/UI Lead in a team of 4 (other roles were Scrum Master,
          Operational Developer, Quality Assurance Lead). I was in charge of
          finalising the app's visual identity and always advocating for the
          user when deciding about functionality.

        Context for the Tinkl project
      </h2>

      <div class="case_study-section">
        <p>
          We brought this project to life during my time at Founders and Coders.
          An external product owner came to us with the problem, and our
          cross-functional team of four used agile methodologies and followed
          the double diamond design process to create an MVP which solves this
          problem.
        </p>
        <p>We designed and built a PWA, which was live for three years.</p>

        Understanding the user
      </h2>

      <div class="case_study-section">
        <h3>User research summary</h3>
        <p>
          We conducted interviews with 4 Londoners who often walk the streets of
          the city. We wanted to understand what they do if they need the
          bathroom when they are out. We also wanted to learn about their
          attitudes to public toilets.
        </p>

        <img
          src="./assets/tinkl/tinkl-user_research.png"
          alt="User research findings: users are reluctant to pay for public toilets, they usually wander around or look for toilet signs, and they would use a toilet finding app if it existed."
          class="bookclub_img"
        />

        <h3>Pain points</h3>
        <p>
          We learned that each person had encountered the problem we were trying
          to solve. They did not have a tried and tested solution to find a
          bathroom to use when they are out in the city, which made some of them
          anxious. They also felt strongly about places charging people to use
          their bathroom.

        Starting the design

      <div class="case_study-section">
        <h3>Competitive audit</h3>
        <p>
          We researched other public toilet finders. We found a couple of apps,
          but their design was very cluttered. The data displayed was not
          consistent as a result of it being open sourced. We knew that we had
          to create a simple and clean user interface with consistent data
          forms.
        </p>

        <h3>User stories</h3>
        <p>
          Main user journey: As a user, I want to find my closest suitable
          toilet ASAP when I’m out and about in London.
        </p>
        <p>User stories:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I want to choose how I input my location.</li>
          <li>I want to select toilets that fit my needs.</li>
          <li>I don’t want to select my filters every time.</li>
          <li>I want to be able to easily navigate between pages.</li>
          <li>I want to get a list of toilets near me.</li>
          <li>I want directions to a particular toilet.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Paper wireframes</h3>
        <p>
          The team did a Crazy Eights exercise to brainstorm ideas for the
          journey's different screens. We agreed to implement the following
          screens.
        </p>

          class="bookclub_img"
        />

        <h3>Low-fidelity digital wireframes</h3>
        <p>
          We then transferred the designs into Figma, and created a prototype
          for user testing.

        Usability testing
      </h2>

      <div class="case_study-section">
        <p>
          We used a low-fidelity prototype on Figma to test the app with real
          users.
        </p>

        <h3>Study details</h3>
        <p>Study type: moderated usability study</p>
        <p>Location: UCL campus, central London</p>
        <p>Participants: 10 passers-by</p>
        <p>Incentive: we gave out lollipops and jokes to participants</p>

        <h3>Findings & themes</h3>
        <p>
          We received a lot of positive feedback on the concept. Having
          experienced the issue we were trying to solve themselves, every
          participant said they would definitely use the app if it existed.
        </p>
        <p>
          We received some constructive feedback on the user experience of the
          prototype. People found the toilet pages with the list of amenities a
          bit excessive and did not like the chekmark/X system. They also found
          the toggle switch on the "Edit toilet" screen confusing.
        </p>

    <section>
      <h2 id="refining-the-design-section" class="case_study-h2">
        Refining the design
      </h2>

      <div class="case_study-section">
        <h3>Styles and high-fidelity wireframes</h3>

        <p>
          We had very little time, so we decided to have a very focused approach
          to the visual design. We wanted to evoke a safe and clean bathroom
          feeling with the help of colours, so we opted for a soft teal and blue
          with an off-white background base.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app needed a logo. We had a lot of fun playing around with it
          (even in the very short amount of time we had), and settled on a
          droplet: a recurring motif in one's journey to the washroom. After
          some heated arguments, we decided on a more sophisticated and tasteful
          blue droplet to be the main mascot. The yellow variant still managed
          to somehow sneak into the designs, and add a little colour to the
          header.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are a few of the landing screen designs. The last one is the
          final version: the outline of the droplet is blurred, giving the
          screen a more subtle vibe (also making it look more professional—we
          did not have the time or resources to draw a high quality logo). We
          also got rid of the face, which helped the app feel less tacky.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./assets/tinkl/tinkl-landing-variations.png"
          alt="Variants for the landing screen."
          class="bookclub_img"
        />
        <p>
          Time constraints meant we had to scale back the functionality: we had
          to stick with the bare minimum for the MVP. The app will help you find
          a suitable toilet near you, but you will not be able to edit or add
          any toilets. This also solved the toggle switch issue we discovered
          during the first round of usability testing.
        </p>
      </div>

    <section>
      <h2 id="building-section">Building & more testing</h2>

      <div class="case_study-section">
        <p>
          Once we had our high-fidelity designs, we spent a week and a half
          building the app. At the end of the build sprints, we took our
          functioning app for a second round of usability testing.
        </p>

        <h3>Usability testing, round 2</h3>
        <p>
          Users still loved the concept and were very excited that a toilet
          finder app exists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants struggled to recognise links on the "Near you" screen.
          These links take the user to Google Maps and show them the directions
          to each toilet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants found certain phrases in the app confusing. They did not
          know what a "public" toilet actually meant, and most of them were
          taken aback by the "Likely free" tag we added to toilets where our
          data did not suggest a fee but we could not be sure it was completely
          free.
        </p>

        <h3>Moving forward</h3>
        <p>
          The app was live and accessible to anyone for three years, after which
          our hosting site switched to paid tiers, which we decided not to pay
          for. We may come back to Tinkl one day and move it to another hosting
          service. If this happens, we shall tackle the feedback we received
          during our second usability testing session. We received
          overwhelmingly positive feedback from users, so I do hope the app will
          go live again.
