          <p>
            I am a product designer, looking for a company or organisation who

          </p>
          <p>
            I previously worked as a <strong>frontend engineer</strong> with a

            In my free time, you can find me sending postcards, longingly
            watching people swing dance or trying and failing to find a bang
            bang cauliflower recipe that actually works.
