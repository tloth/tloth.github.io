        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>
          I am a product designer in training, looking for a company or
          organisation who care about their users as much as I do!
        </p>
        <p>
          I previously worked as a front-end engineer with a strong focus on
          accessibility and design systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, you can find me sending postcards, longingly watching
          people swing dance or trying and failing to find a bang bang
          cauliflower recipe that actually works.

              Sadly, the app was live only until the beginning of 2023, but you
              can read and see more about the design and build process

            <p>
              Some landing pages I built for Habito when I was working as a
              front-end engineer

              I decided to include these here because I'm very proud of building
              them and I learned a lot about fun but still accessible design and
              design-engineering collaboration in the process
