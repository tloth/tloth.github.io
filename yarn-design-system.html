        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://app.yarn.family" target="_blank">Yarn</a> is an
          AI-powered interactive storytelling app for children. We had a working
          prototype built in vanilla HTML, CSS, JS and Python, but in order to
          add more features and polish the experience we needed to rebuild the
          app in a more structured and scalable manner. This case study follows
          the process of planning, designing and building the Yarn Design System
          (YDS).

        <h3>My role</h3>
        <p>
          I was the lead designer on this project, while also fulfilling
          frontend engineering tasks.
        </p>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Having worked on design systems at other startups, I knew that
          introducing one to yarn would provide consistency and enable a much
          faster product development process.
        </p>
        <p>As the project lead, I:</p>

      <div class="case_study-section">
        <p>
          I proposed using a design system, and once it got signed off, I began
          planning the process. This project needed to fit into the larger app
          rebuild timeline, so I worked with the CEO, our main stakeholder, to
          come up with a timeframe that fit all of us.
        </p>
        <p>
          The CEO and I had already laid out the app’s information architecture
          in FigJam, which helped see which components we needed to build
          throughout all user flows.

        />

        <h3>Measuring success</h3>
        <p></p>

        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>
          We believe in prioritising accessibility from the very beginning, so I
          proposed accessibility guidelines for the whole team to agree on. Yarn
          is an early-stage startup with limited resources, so we decided to
          focus our initial efforts on the fundamentals and defer more complex
          work (such as screen reader accessibility) until a later stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, we agreed to only create designs and publish code that
          adheres to the following (as per
          <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/"
            target="_blank"
            >WCAG guidelines</a
          >
          and the
          <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/intro#understanding-the-four-principles-of-accessibility"
            target="_blank"
            >POUR principles</a
          >):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All layouts are responsive; all content is visible and operable on
            any screen.
          </li>
          <li>We always use semantic HTML.</li>
          <li>There is sufficient colour contrast, and all text is legible.</li>
          <li>
            Users are able to navigate our product using only the keyboard.
          </li>
          <li>Our links are descriptive.</li>
          <li>Informative or important images have descriptive alt text.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Structure</h3>
        <p>
          I considered using an existing component library that we could update
          to fit our visual needs, but I decided to build everything from
          scratch to have more control over our components. For example, I knew
          we would need a microphone button with very specific technical
          requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took the
          <a href="https://hds.hel.fi/" target="_blank"
            >Helsinki Design System</a
          >
          as my main source of inspiration and decided to divide our design
          system into Foundations and Components.
        </p>
        <p>
          Foundations: design tokens (colours, typography, spacing), assets
          (icons, background textures, images), guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Components: CTAs, form inputs, header, other components that appear in
          the product more than once.
        </p>

          style="display: block; max-width: 100%; margin: 0 auto"
        />
        <h3>Taking stock of what already existed</h3>
        <p>
          Before starting the designs, I took stock of the tokens and components
          we already had. We had branding guidelines that included colours,
          icons and typography, as well as several CTAs (buttons/links) which
          could be reused with only minor alterations.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 id="design-section" class="case_study-h2">Design</h2>
      <div class="case_study-section">
        <p>
          I started with declaring our breakpoints and minimum screen size that
          we were happy to support. This, alongside grids and spacing values,
          ensured that all of our screens were responsive.
        </p>
        <p>
          For interactive elements I covered all relevant states. For CTAs, for
          example, I designed default, hover, focus and pressed states. (I did
          not design disabled buttons because I think they are a poor UX
          pattern.)
        </p>
        <p>
          To meet our accessibility goals, I had to play with some colours,
          textures and font size to make sure everything was legible while also
          delivering what the stakeholders were looking for in terms of user
          delight. For example, they were adamant on using our beautiful
          textures for the app’s background, which made certain text difficult
          to read. In some cases, I made the patterns more faint, in others, I
          added blobs of solid colour behind text to keep writing legible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the design phase, I liaised with the team and with the
          stakeholders continuously, considering any feedback from them. We
          caught up in our daily standup, and once a chunk of design (e.g.
          tokens, CTAs, menus) was ready, I had the team review it to keep the
          process as agile as possible.

      <h2 id="build-section" class="case_study-h2">Build</h2>
      <div class="case_study-section">
        <p>
          In the engineering team, we decided to rebuild the app using React,
          TypeScript and Next.js, to optimise for speed and quality. As for the
          CSS technology, the team had differing opinions. I aimed to design the
          design system in a way that could work with any technology, and the
          components were indeed fun and fast to build using Styled Components,
          our first chosen library. We later ran into limitations with server
          side rendering, and ended up switching to Tailwind, which is optimised
          for Next.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          After declaring the design tokens such as colours, typography and
          breakpoints, we divided the components between us, and built them
          continuously as we were building out the app’s pages. Developing each
          component in context prevented issues about sizing and spacing that
          may have occurred later down the line if we had been building the
          components in isolation. For instance, building our Text CTAs in
          context made me realise that I had not yet defined a maximum width,
          and they stretched all across the screen–it made me think more
          carefully about our page layout, and adjust it to align with the
          screen widths I had declared in the design system.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made sure to review every PR to ensure the components’ quality and
          that we were keeping to the guidelines we had set out at the
          beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each new item was added to Storybook to create a catalogue of all
          reusable components with their variants. We used manual QA methods to
          ensure that each screen follows the guidelines we had set out at the
          beginning of the project.

        Continuous iteration
      </h2>

      <div class="case_study-section">
        <p>
          The old app had no component library and no reusable design tokens,
          which made for a tedious and unsafe development process. In the new
          app, with the help of the design system, adding new components has
          been very easy. Following the guidelines and using our design tokens,
          it is now simple to make sure everything stays accessible and visually
          consistent with the rest of the app. It also helps other designers and
          engineers contribute, as everything is documented, which gives
          contributors confidence and independence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stakeholders were very content with having a central collection of
          components that they can review in one place, and they gave positive
          feedback about the general feel of the user flow. They were also
          pleased with the speed with which we rebuilt the app, which was in
          large part thanks to YDS.
        </p>

        <h3>Visual testing</h3>
        <p>
          We originally planned to set up visual diff testing for each
          component, which allows for a much faster and safer development
          process. There was not enough time to finish setting up the tests,
          doing so is one of our next steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          I saw the benefits at my previous company, Habito, where my team
          completed a visual reskin of the entire product in just three weeks—in
          large part thanks to the use of a design system that incorporated this
          type of test, allowing us to easily catch any components or outliers
          that we may have missed.
        </p>

        <h3>Going forward</h3>
        <p>
          Other than setting up visual diff testing, the plan is to keep the
          design system updated. We shall do this with regular, quarterly
          reviews, where every team is present (design, engineering, product).
          Ideally, we would set up a design system guild to have dedicated time
          for continuous improvements and assurance of the app’s quality and
          visual consistency.
