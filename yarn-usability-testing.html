        Project overview
      </h2>

      <div class="case_study-section">
        <p>
          As a very young startup with limited resources, yarn launched a
          functional MVP app. We had made some assumptions which we wanted to
          validate with real users before building the app further.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the sole product designer, I arranged usability testing sessions to
          gather insights into how our app is doing. Based on the findings, my
          team and I got together to understand the data and turn user feedback
          into actionable tasks and pave the further development of the project.

      <div class="case_study-section">
        <p>
          <a href="https://app.yarn.family" target="_blank">Yarn</a> is an
          AI-powered interactive storytelling app for children. We are on a
          mission to nourish children's creativity by letting them spin yarns
          and be in control of their stories.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./assets/yarn/usability/yarn-input.png"
          alt="The yarn app is asking Mimi what yarn they want to spin today. A microphone button is pulsing while a curious red cat ponders about what to say."
          class="wm-400px"
          style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"
        />
        <p>
          The app asks the user what yarn (story) they want to spin. The user
          has the option to type, take a photo, or tell the app their ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yarn then generates the beginning of a story, then asks the user for
          more input. It is an interactive process, which means there is a lot
          of user interaction with the microphone button.

        Usability testing sessions

      <div class="case_study-section">
        <p>
          I reached out to parents with children in yarn’s target age group and
          arranged sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I prepared open-ended questions so we get the most unbiased results
          possible, and bite-sized tasks to keep the children engaged (it is
          quite difficult to keep a 4 year old child focused!)
        </p>
        <p>We recorded each session and took notes to be used later.</p>

        Data synthesising workshop
      </h2>

      <div class="case_study-section">
        <p>
          I planned a 3 hour long workshop for the team to sort the raw
          usability testing feedback into categories, find recurring themes,
          draw insights, and eventually come up with actionable tasks based on
          all the data.
        </p>
        <p>
          We used FigJam and had a great time raking through all the insights.

        Actionable tasks
      </h2>

      <div class="case_study-section">
        <p>
          We ended up with quite a few findings that we turned into action
          points. In a later session, we prioritised these items, which helped
          us figure out the roadmap for further product development. Here are
          some examples.
        </p>

        <h3>Straightforward bugs to fix immediately</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Children especially struggled to tap the play/pause button. We
            increased its size and have not had any issues with it since.
          </li>
          <li>
            Children would often tap the "replay audio" button by accident,
            which would lock the experience until the audio finished playing
            again. We added a skip button to this screen as a much needed escape
            hatch.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Issues that needed a few days’ design and engineering work</h3>
        <p>
          Every child and most parents struggled with the microphone button.
          They either started speaking before activating the mic, or they double
          tapped the button which then submitted before they could start
          speaking.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To mitigate the first problem, we made the visual difference between
            the microphone's possible states clearer, and added sound effects to
            activating the mic and submitting your input, which children learned
            after one or two uses—they now know to wait for the activation sound
            before speaking.
          </li>
          <li>
            Handling the second problem was more programmatical—the app now only
            lets a user submit a voice input after a couple of seconds have
            passed, which prevents users from accidentally submitting by double
            tapping the button.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <img
          src="./assets/yarn/usability/yarn-mic-cta.png"
          alt="Yarn's microphone CTA comopnent in its different states: default, hover, focus (keyboard), activated, recording."
          class="w-100"
        />

        <h3>Larger problems that required design exploration</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            There was and still is a quite significant loading time for each
            yarn snippet. The monotonously spinning snail was cute but it did
            not manage to keep the users engaged. We ended up reworking the
            entire wait experience through a longer project.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Positive feedback</h3>
        <p>
          We made sure to also take note of positive feedback—users delighted in
          the characters they created and were excited about the app changing
          the story based on their inputs. Our actionable task for the future
          was to utilise every interaction (be it button taps or emails) to
          delight the user.

        <p>
          Doing usability testing sessions and efficiently synthesising the
          findings with the team proved very useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Involving the entire team meant that there was now more awareness of
          our users and the value of testing with real people. It also guided us
          to improve the product in ways that paved the path to happier users
          and higher retention rates.
