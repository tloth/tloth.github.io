      <h3>The product</h3>
      <p>
        Book Club web app for a book club to keep track of what books members
        have read and when
      </p>
      <h3>Project duration</h3>
      <p>March - April 2023 (design phase)</p>

      <img
        src="./assets/bookclub/bookclub-preview.png"
        alt="Preview of the app on a laptop and on mobile"
        class="bookclub_img"
      />

      <h3>The problem</h3>
      <p>
        The Book Club does not have a single source of truth for which books
        members have read, when, whose choice it was and where they held the
        meeting
      </p>

      <h3>The goal</h3>
      <p>
        A web app to serve as an information hub for the Book Club with accurate
        statistics
      </p>

        Context for the Book Club
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Book Club is a self-organised group of 3-6 people (currently 4).
        Members take turns suggesting 3 books to read, from which the others
        vote democratically for one. They agree on a time and date to meet, this
        usually allows one or two months to read the book. All the organising
        happens in a WhatsApp group chat.
      </p>

        Understanding the user
      </h2>
      <h3>User research summary</h3>
      <p>
        We conducted interviews with 3 members of the Book Club. We wanted to
        understand why they are still in the Book Club after months/years as it
        is a community-driven club with no financial or other tangible incentive
        to read and discuss books other than a love for books and spending time
        together.
      </p>
      <p>
        An assumption we made was there being a need to save notes and quotes in
        one place that readers can later go back to. The interviews, however,
        showed only two readers confirming this.
      </p>
      <p>
        All readers mentioned it being hard to look up a book they had read
        before if they can't remember the title or author.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a wide range of platforms readers consume their books on:
        physical copies, e-readers, audiobooks (via an app or sometimes even
        Youtube).
      </p>

      <h3>Pain points</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>saving notes and quotes in one place</li>
        <li>looking up a book if they don't remember the title</li>
        <li>not remembering whose turn it is to pick a book next</li>
        <li>voting for a book</li>
        <li>finding a time and date that works for everyone</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Problem statement</h3>
      <p>
        Minna is a Book Club member who needs a way to organise and keep track
        of Book Club meetings and the books they read because she wants to keep
        a record of all the books and meetings in one place.

      <h3>Competitive audit</h3>
      <p>
        We audited two book club apps, Bookclubs and Fable, and noticed that
        both have a very simple colour scheme in order to let the book covers
        stand out.
      </p>
      <h3>Abandoned features</h3>
      <p>
        We did Crazy Eights exercises to come up with ideas for two problems:
        voting for a book from three options and finding a meeting time and date
        that works for everybody.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the voting feature in the Book Club app would require members to
        leave WhatsApp (where we currently handle all the organising), use the
        app, then come back to WhatsApp. This is way more hassle than using
        WhatsApp's new poll feature (or even just typing out the three options),
        so we decided to leave the voting feature out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finding a meeting time and date has been quite difficult in the group
        chat, however, moving this to the app would make the process easier only
        if everyone had an always up-to-date digital calendar that they wouldn't
        mind sharing, which not everybody does. Hence this feature was scrapped,
        too.
      </p>

      <h3>Sitemap</h3>
      <img
        src="./assets/bookclub/bookclub-sitemap1.png"
        alt="Initial sitemap"
        class="bookclub_img"
      />
      <p>
        The first usability testing session showed that the initial low-fidelity
        digital wireframes based on this sitemap were highly confusing. What was
        the difference between a book and a meeting? Aren't they interconnected?
        So we started from scratch and created a new sitemap based on user
        stories.
      </p>

      <h3>User stories</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I want to <strong>add a new book</strong> when the group decides what
          to read next
        </li>
        <li>
          I want to <strong>create a new meeting</strong> when the group decides
          where and when to meet to discuss the book
        </li>
        <li>
          I want to immediately
          <strong
            >see what the club is currently reading and the details of the next
            meeting</strong
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          I want to <strong>take notes and save quotes</strong> from the book
          I'm currently reading
        </li>
        <li>I want to <strong>see all the books</strong> the club has read</li>
        <li>
          I want to <strong>filter and search the books</strong> the club has
          read
        </li>
        <li>
          For each book, I want to see the details, my notes and rating, and
          meeting details in one place (members present, ratings, where and
          when)
        </li>
        <li>I want to see all the current and past members of the club</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Sitemap v2</h3>
      <img
        src="./assets/bookclub/bookclub-sitemap2.png"
        alt="Updated sitemap"
        class="bookclub_img"
      />
      <p>
        We merged books and meetings to be one entity and removed the "Members"
        page as it did not serve a purpose with the revised user stories.
      </p>

      <h3>Study details</h3>
      <p>Study type: moderated usability study</p>
      <p>Location: online remote in the UK</p>
      <p>Participants: 4 participants (all book club members or book lovers)</p>

      <h3>Findings & themes</h3>
      <p>
        After compiling the findings with the help of an affinity diagram, we
        discovered the following themes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>How users search for books</p>
          <ul>
            <li>scroll and skim to find book</li>
            <li>search for tags —> books need tags</li>
            <li>search by date —> need visible timeline/dates</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Confusion over</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              “Books”: we need to make the scope of the app clear: Book Club
              only, not all the books in the world like Goodreads
            </li>
            <li>
              “Profile”: profile page should only contain account information;
              have a separate “My shelves” page for a personalised books page
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>Edit icon was not intuitive</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>Suggestions from users</p>
          <ul>
            <li>want to see ratings (individual, average)</li>
            <li>see other people's notes & quotes after the meeting</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Users have different ways of searching for books in a list: search for
          keywords, search for dates, skim visually by scrolling. (Dates are
          already visible under each book. The covers are there so users can
          scroll and skim.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Users get confused by the scope of the app: does it contain all the
          books they have read or only books the Book Club has read? (This
          should be clear once the app is populated. Book clubs only for now.
          Rename sections to make clearer.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Users expect to find basic personal and account information on the
          "Profile" page
        </li>
        <li>
          Users expect to find their personalised book collections on a
          different page, most commonly on “My shelves”
        </li>
        <li>Users want to rate books and see other people's ratings</li>
        <li>
          Users want to see other people's notes and quotes after the Book Club
          meeting
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Actionable tasks based on insights (prioritised)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          P0: Profile page should contain account information only. Navbar:
          rename “Books” to “Club books”, add “My shelves”, rename “Profile” to
          “My account”
        </li>
        <li>
          P0: Create new “My shelves” page for personalised book lists (”Books I
          have read”, “Books I want to read”). Rename “Books I have read” to
          “Club books I have read”
        </li>
        <li>P0: Rate book, see average rating for each book</li>
        <li>
          P1: Add tags to books which you can then search for/filter books by
          (might be available via an API)
        </li>
        <li>
          P2: Reveal everyone's notes and quotes on the book page after the
          meeting
        </li>

      <h3>Sticker sheet and high-fidelity wireframes</h3>
      <div class="grid">
        <div>
          <p>
            First of all, we created a
            <a
              href="https://www.figma.com/file/tXqoGNZkkOc7D23vt9jeiE/Book-Club?node-id=30%3A2&t=kOQga3oQ3dWXYnFP-1"
              >sticker sheet</a
            >
            with reusable components to make the process more streamlined and
            flexible.
          </p>
          <p>
            I always keep accessibility in the forefront of my mind. We tested
            the colour contrast using WebAIM's contrast checker, and set the
            base/smallest font size to be 18pt. We made sure each interactive
            element has enough padding for bigger fingers or shaky cursors. We
            made each interactive element stand out so users can be certain
            about what they can click or tap. I will liaise with the developer
            to make sure that there is a logical flow for keyboard and/or
            screenreader users and that the headings are in a hierarchical
            order.
          </p>
          <p>
            We turned the most common components into Figma components for ease
            (navbar and CTAs).
          </p>
        </div>
        <img
          src="./assets/bookclub/bookclub-sticker_sheet-atoms.png"
          alt="Sticker sheet atoms"
          class="bookclub_img"
        />
      </div>
      <img
        src="./assets/bookclub/bookclub-sticker_sheet-components.jpg"
        alt="Sticker sheet components"
        class="bookclub_img"
      />

        alt="Sticker sheet navbar for mobile"
        class="bookclub_img"
      />
      <p>
        I used a Wacom digital tablet to create some simple illustrations (they
        are the Book Club members' favourite animals enjoying some literature!)
        to spice up the otherwise simple colour scheme and designs.
      </p>
      <img
        src="./assets/bookclub/bookclub-illustrations.png"
        alt="Illustrations of an elephant, a hedgehog, a seal, a duck and an owl consuming books in different formats: physical books, audiobook, an e-reader."
        class="bookclub_img"
      />

      <p>
        We designed for desktop and mobile screens, and used the smallest
        possible frame for both. This will make it easier for developers to
        implement the designs. The grid we used also restricts the content to
        never overflow on huge screens and stay legible and skimmable to the
        human eye.
      </p>

      <h3>Specific areas of improvement</h3>

      <h4>Navbar</h4>
      <p>We renamed navigation items for clarity.</p>

        alt="Navbar before"
        class="bookclub_img"

        alt="Navbar after"
        class="bookclub_img"
      />

      <h4>"My shelves" page</h4>
      <p>
        We renamed navigation items for clarity. "Books I have read" became
        "Club books I have read", and "Books I want to read" became "Books I
        want us to read" to make the scope of this page clear.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second round of usability testing, where the tasks were the same as
        in the first round, was overall very positive. Users found the flow
        intuitive and pleasant. See

      <p>Some suggestions came up that we will definitely consider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fill up space on homepage with most used action (e.g. "Add quote")
        </li>
        <li>Show who chose each book</li>
        <li>
          Remove “Mark all as TBC” from "Add new book" page, default time, date
          and location to TBC
        </li>
        <li>Make it clear which section is visible to everyone/only you</li>
        <li>Move "Sort by" and "Search" under the “Currently reading” box</li>
        <li>Extend "Sort by"</li>

            The app is currently in development. First, we annotated the Figma
            designs with heading levels, functionality comments and engineering
            questions. Then we sat down with the engineering team to go through
            the annotations and raise/answer any questions.
